Zerg AI for Starcraft: Brood War

Currently, this AI is only capable of 4-pooling (see below for reference). It can beat Brood War's AI,

Issues to fix:

- Targetting: There needs to be some kind of targetting hierarchy that causes units to attack combat units first, then buildings or workers.

Future changes:

- Targetting can always be improved
- More complicated build orders. Will probably start with 9 Pool ZvZ builds
